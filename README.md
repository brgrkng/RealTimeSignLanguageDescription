# RealTimeSignLanguageDescription
Real time sign language detection model using transfer learning.

Description:
Project is based on a tutorial video for face mask detection. https://youtube.com/watch?v=IOI0o3Cxv9Q&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE.
The same process was used except instead of a face mask, sign language was used. In the video the ground truth labels are 'mask' and 'no mask'. 
Here we use a number of different signs in ASL instead, where each label is performed infront of a camera and labeled accordingly.
